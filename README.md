# BookMyShow API
The project involves using NodeJS with express to build APIs for a movie booking application, We have named it BookMyShow. 

We have exposed two endpoints as per the requirements of the project:

**/api/booking** **:method:GET** : Will retrieve the last booking details from the MongoDB BookMyShow collection and send it to the client with 200 status code, if no booking found; will still return 200 with no bookings found message, 500 status code will be returned with error message in case of server connection error

**/api/booking** **:method:POST** : Will create a booking document  in the MongoDB collection after schema validation and send 200 status to the client for success and 400 status code incase of error

 ## directoryðŸ’ 
    We have split the schema, the app and the routes into different modules
 - **/src/app**- Contains the code for mongoDB atlas connection and  express app spawning
 - **/src/Models**- Contains the Schema.js file which holds the schema for the Booking object for mongoDB
- **/src/Routest**- Contains the Routes.js file which holds the code to the API endpoint routes
